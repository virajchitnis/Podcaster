Podcaster
=========

Host your own podcasts on your server.

Intro
-----

My brother recently started podcasting, and in order to help publish his podcasts, I created a nodejs application that runs on my server.
I have decided to create an open source version of this application and release it here. 

Setup
-----

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the `setup.sh` script.
3. Start the server: `npm start`.
